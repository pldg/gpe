 * Consecutive breakpoints are breakpoints whose media queries and size can be
 * merged inside a *sizes* attribute. They must have the same art of the
 * *globalBreakpoint* and they must have size property declared.
 *
 * Example: `sizes="(min-width:900px) 25vw, (min-width:600px) 50vw, 100vw"`.
 *
 * @see {@link generate-size-with-media-queries.js} for more information.
 *
 * @returns {Object[]|undefined} List of consecutive breakpoints; otherwise
 * `undefined`.
